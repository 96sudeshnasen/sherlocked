### convergence_check.py

convergence_check.py[] file runs the neural net for activation function combinations ```relu_relu_relu, relu_sigmoid_relu, 
relu_sigmoid_tanh ``` in the three layers with 50 epochs and plots the training and the test errors for each epoch.

### comparing_sigmoid3vsrelu3.py

This file gives training and test errors for ``` relu_relu_relu, sigmoid_sigmoid_sigmoid ``` combinations for 10 epochs for
different values of learning rate.
